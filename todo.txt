Handle the logic for editing a task using a sheet modal that comes from the right

Explore documention on supabase users and now I can intergrate users into this current
project

*** DON'T FORGET TO SWITCH BACK TO SUPABASE FROM SQLITE


********** TODO FOR TOMOROW

Account Page should have logic to edit account info
possibly done  = Error handling, redirecting to error page and passing props to describe error

sign up confirm password and make sure its longer than 6 and other sign up constraints
 account page editing username and email and possibly password as well as login forgot password

 maybe maybe maybe avatar image and supabase storage

password reset working 

setup logic for signing up but user exists already
